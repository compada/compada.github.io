20. BREACH OF TERMS OF USE AND LIQUIDATED DAMAGES

    You understand that the content in each report or record on Compada has significant value to Compada and that the damage caused to Compada for any violation of these Terms of Use pertaining to a report or record will be difficult to accurately estimate.

    If you post Content in violation of these Terms of Use, you agree to promptly pay Compada One for each item of Content posted in violation of these Terms of Use. We may (but shall not be required to) to issue you a warning before assessing damages.

    If you display, copy, duplicate, reproduce, sell, re-sell or exploit for any purpose any Content in violation of these Terms of Use, you agree to pay for each record or report that you displayed, copied, duplicated, reproduced, sold, re-sold or exploited for any purpose.

Notwithstanding any other provision of these Terms of Use, we reserve the right to seek the remedy of specific performance of any term contained herein, or a preliminary or permanent injunction against the breach of any such term or in aid of the exercise of any power granted in these Terms of Use, or any combination thereof.

21. ENTIRE AGREEMENT

    These Terms of Use and other agreements, rules, and policies incorporated by reference to these Terms including, without limitation, the Privacy Policy, constitutes the entire agreement between you and Compada. It supersedes any prior or contemporaneous negotiations, discussions or agreements, whether written or oral, between you and Compada regarding the subject matter contained in these Terms of Use. Additional terms and conditions may exist between you and third parties, including but not limited to, Service Providers and others. You represent and warrant that those third-party agreements do not interfere with your obligations and duties to Compada under these Terms of Use.

22. MUTUAL ARBITRATION AGREEMENT

    1. Informal Negotiations. To expedite resolution and reduce the cost of any dispute, controversy or claim, past, present, or future, between you and Compada, including without limitation any dispute or claim related to or arising out of this Agreement ("Dispute"), you and Compada may attempt to negotiate any Dispute informally (the "Informal Negotiations") before initiating any arbitration or court proceeding. Such Informal Negotiations will commence upon written notice. Your address for any notices under this Section is your physical address that you have provided to Compada. Compada's email address for such notices is [support@compada.io](mailto:support@compada.io?subject=Attn: Legal Department), Attn: Legal Department.

    2. Arbitration. If a Dispute is not resolved through Informal Negotiations, you and Compada agree to resolve any and all Disputes (except those Disputes expressly excluded below) through final and binding arbitration ("Arbitration Agreement"). This Arbitration Agreement shall be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act and evidences a transaction involving commerce. The arbitration will be commenced and conducted before a single arbitrator under the Commercial Arbitration Rules (the "AAA Rules") of the American Arbitration Association ("AAA") and, where appropriate, the AAA's Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes ("AAA Consumer Rules"), both of which are available at the AAA website (www.adr.org). Your arbitration fees and your share of arbitrator compensation will be governed by the AAA Rules (and, where appropriate, limited by the AAA Consumer Rules). Each party will pay the fees for his/her or its own attorneys, subject to any remedies to which that party may later be entitled under applicable law. The arbitrator will make a decision in writing. Additionally, the arbitrator, and not any federal, state, or local court or agency, shall have the exclusive authority to resolve any dispute relating to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability, or formation of this Arbitration Agreement. However, the preceding sentence shall not apply to the "Class Action Waiver" described in Subsection (4) below.

    3. Excluded Disputes. You and Compada agree that the following Disputes are excluded from this Arbitration Agreement: (1) any Dispute seeking to enforce or protect, or concerning the validity of, any of your or our intellectual property rights; (2) individual claims in small claims court; (3) any claim that an applicable federal statute expressly states cannot be arbitrated; and (4) any claim for injunctive relief.

    4. Waiver of Right to be a Plaintiff or Class Member in a Class Action. To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, You and Compada agree to bring any Dispute in arbitration on an individual basis only, and not as a class or collective action. There will be no right or authority for any Dispute to be brought, heard or arbitrated as a class or collective action ("Class Action Waiver"). Regardless of anything else in this Arbitration Agreement and/or the applicable AAA Rules or AAA Consumer Rules, the interpretation, applicability, enforceability or formation of the Class Action Waiver may only be determined by a court and not an arbitrator.

    5. Rules/Standards Governing Arbitration Proceeding. A party who wishes to arbitrate a Dispute covered by this Arbitration Agreement must initiate an arbitration proceeding no later than the expiration of the statute of limitations that applicable law prescribes for the claim asserted. The arbitrator shall apply the statute of limitations that would have applied if the Dispute had been brought in court. The arbitrator may award any remedy to which a party is entitled under applicable law, but remedies shall be limited to those that would be available to a party in their individual capacity, and no remedies that otherwise would be available to an individual under applicable law will be forfeited. The arbitrator is without authority to apply any different substantive law. The parties have the right to conduct adequate civil discovery and present witnesses and evidence as needed to present their cases and defenses, and any dispute in this regard shall be decided by the arbitrator. The location of the arbitration proceeding shall take place in the city or county where you reside, unless each party agrees otherwise. A court of competent jurisdiction shall have the authority to enter judgment upon the arbitrator's decision/award.

    6. Severability. You and Compada agree that if any portion of this Section entitled "Mutual Arbitration Agreement" is found illegal or unenforceable, that portion will be severed, and the remainder of this Section will be given full force and effect.

23. GOVERNING LAW

    This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Indiana, without giving effect to any choice or conflict of law provision or rule (either of the State of Indiana or any other jurisdiction) that would cause the application of the laws of any jurisdiction other than the State of Indiana.

24. MISCELLANEOUS

    If you breach any term of these Terms of Use or other agreement with Compada, Compada may pursue any legal or equitable remedy available, including but not limited to, direct, consequential, and punitive damages and injunctive relief. Compada remedies are cumulative and not exclusive. Failure of Compada to exercise any remedy or enforce any portion of the Terms of Use at any time shall not operate as a waiver of any remedy or of the right to enforce any portion of the Agreement at any time thereafter.

    If any provision of the Terms of Use is found to be unenforceable or invalid, that provision shall be limited or eliminated to the minimum extent necessary so that the Terms shall otherwise remain in full force and effect and enforceable.

    These Terms of Use are not assignable, transferable or sublicensable by you except with Compada prior written consent. We may transfer, assign or delegate the Terms and its rights and obligations without consent.
