## Problem

It may be overwhelming to know that LinkedIn has over 13 million management consultants listed. These numbers point to an obvious problem if you are a small business leader.

Business and risk are two words that have been synonymous with each other since their inception. Chances are you have a lot at stake if you are a small business owner.

[Research shows](https://www.fundera.com/blog/what-percentage-of-small-businesses-fail) that 20% of small businesses fail within their first year, 30% fail in the second year and 50% fail after five years. Leaving only 30% of small businesses able to operate past the 10 years.

Why do businesses close down so quickly?

Business owners operate with a common goal in mind â€” grow business and maximize profits. There are many obstacles that can compromise the growth of a business, such as problems in your strategy that affect your perception of the business' current status. As some CEOs have shared with Compada, they only know what they know. If you are reading this, you are in luck as these challenges can be avoided by simply growing your familiarity with them before they occur. This is in part Compada's mission!

### A common problem businesses encounter when scaling operations is scaling too soon

Premature scaling is a major reason why many companies have a hard time getting to the next level. Scaling is about growing as efficiently as possible. However, if a business scales too quickly, neither the product, operations, revenue, nor talent will be ready. Resulting in a loss of control over both the internal and external operations.

If your business hires sales reps before the product is ready for broader market adoption, you get new customers with needs not previously anticipated resulting in pressures to client success and product roadmap. On the flip side, if you add more product development but no increased customer conversations, you risk a compromised roadmap with little to no market demand. Either of these problems can have a severe impact on small businesses with limited financial resources.

### Scaling is not growth

There is a big difference between scaling and growing. Many companies mistakenly believe that the two are synonymous. To help you get a better understanding of the terms, here is a quick definition from our dictionary.

- **Growing**

  Increasing top-line revenues at any cost

- **Scaling**

  Increasing revenues while minimizing your costs, effectively improving your bottom-line or profit margin

As a business grows, so does the need for more staff to serve clients. Also, a rise in revenue means an increase of resources. While scaling a business means maximizing profits, the demand for resources is increasing at a slower rate.

This is a clear indication that growth does not necessarily translate into scaling. While it's great to see your business grow, the point at which your company can handle increasing sales while still providing high-quality services at a reasonable price is when your company is scaling up. This indicates that your company is performing well and ready to take on the market.

## Solution

Growth can also be viewed as a prerequisite for scaling. When you realize you are no longer a small team of five people, but a large business with 10-30 employees, you enter the growth stage. Scaling refers to a stage following growth. These companies typically have 20-300 employees and are able handle increasing numbers of clients and sales more cost-effectively.
Speak to a Compada Advisor with experience in scaling for a temperature check. This is because they have been integral in experimenting with scaling businesses before, sometimes more than once. Compada Advisors will help you determine if your company is ready for scaling by analyzing several attributes of your business such as product roadmap, sales playbook (customer adoption cycles, attrition, retention), marketing strategy, people operations, and/or talent skill gap alignment.

Compada will help your business scale efficiently by identifying your competitive edge and customizing a playbook to fit your needs, without compromising quality, and automating your operational processes.
