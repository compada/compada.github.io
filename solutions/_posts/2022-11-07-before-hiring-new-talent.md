Hiring new talent is integral to any business that wants to scale. To begin addressing this pillar of business scalability we will explore when you should double down on existing talent by reinvesting in their development, and when to look outside of your organization by performing a skill gap analysis. There are many facets of hiring that we can address, such as when to hire a recruiter, what recruiter skill level your business requires, how to build and maintain employer branding, how to prepare hiring managers for interviewing, and how to manage candidates through the hiring process to protect your business. However, despite so many categories to consider, before any of these topics can be addressed you need to know which skills your business requires to meet your scalability goals. As several small business leaders have shared with Compada, oftentimes they find themselves operating in fire fighter mode. Most hiring decisions are made to aid the firefight rather than to align to the broader scalability goals.  
## Skill Gap Analysis ##

In any competitive industry, it is not easy to find the right talent to scale your business. It is essential that you hire people with the right skills and cultural fit for your company. Skills gap refers to the difference in the skills that your organization requires to execute its strategy successfully and the skills that are available in your current workforce. Your organization's skills gap analysis will help identify and address any gaps. You can then plan how to close them, whether that be through training, hiring or outsourcing.

### Solution ###

Before hiring outside help for your growing business, understand whether or not you are merely backfilling a partial role or hiring to execute against a brother strategy. This exercise will also help you understand if you require backfilling a role in the future should you have a departure from your team. The following 3 steps will help you narrow your focus.

- Determine skills required and level of proficiency needed
- Assess existing skills and how they match your broader business scalability goals 
- Reduce skills gaps by identifying what areas need to be filled

### 1. Determine the skills required and level of proficiency needed ###

First, consider the skills needed to implement your current and future business strategy. Consider the soft and technical skills required to implement these strategies. Start by listing your business objectives and mapping competencies to each objective. Once you have created a list with the required skills, take note of the skill level that each skill requires (e.g., basic intermediate or advanced).

### 2. Assess your existing skills ###

Determine what skills are available to your workforce. You can use tools like:
- Performance evaluations 
- 360s review
- Skills assessment tests
- Behavioral assessments

Compare your results to the skills required to implement your business strategy. This should make any areas that need to be filled apparent.

### 3. Reduce skills gaps ###

There are many options to address skills gaps: outsourcing, training, mentoring and hiring.
Depending on the timing that you require the skill, the speed at which existing employees can fill the gap, your budget for development and coaching, the method you choose needs to be determined by your business goals.

- Mentoring - less time efficient, but cost effective
- Training - more time efficient, but less cost effective
- Hiring - long term solution, but requires more energy to manage hiring process
- Outsourcing - short term solution, or project based work for roles that are not immediate
